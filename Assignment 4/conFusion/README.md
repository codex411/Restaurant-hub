# RestaurantHub

A full-featured Angular application with HTTP services, REST API integration, and advanced state management.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

### Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## 🌐 REST API Server

This assignment includes a JSON server for simulating REST API endpoints.

### Setup

1. Install json-server globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

2. Navigate to the json-server directory:
   ```bash
   cd json-server
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json -d 2000
   ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000/` with a 2-second delay to simulate network latency.
